	"instructions": "1) Preheat oven to 425 F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper\n2) In a medium bowl, combine the almond flour, baking powder, garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix until well combined.\n3) Put the mozzarella and cream cheese in a large microwave-safe mixing bowl and microwave for 1 minute. Combine using a rubber spatula. Microwave for another 1 minute, until the cheese has melted, then stir once more.\n4) Crack one of the eggs into a small bowl and fork whisk.\n5) To the mixing bowl, add the remaining egg and 3/4 of the first egg. mIxx until all ingredients are well incorporated. You can either add more almond flour if dough is to soft to roll or put on the micrawave if it gets to stringy and unworkable.\n 6) Divide it into 10 to 20 equal portions (depends on the size you want for your pretzels but I usually do small ones)\n7) Roll each portion into a long, thin piece and fold into the shape of a pretzel.\n8) Brush the top of each pretzel with the egg wash\n9) Sprinkle parmesan cheese and bake for 12 to 14 minutes or until golden brown",
